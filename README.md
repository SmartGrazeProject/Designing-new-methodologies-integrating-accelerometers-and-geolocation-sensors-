This repository contains various resources used for the article "Designing new methodologies integrating accelerometers and geolocation sensors for the high-resolution monitoring of the grazing behaviour of cows". Below is an overview of the contents available for download.

### Contents

## 1. [Matlab_Steps_Explanation.xlsx]

- **Description:** This Excel file provides a detailed explanation of each MATLAB code used in the project. It includes information about their roles, input data requirements, and output data generated.

## 2. Data

- **Description:** ZIP files containing the data used as input for the project.
- **Files:**
  - [BaseData_Behavior.zip] = The behaviors coded with the program Cowlog for each video.
  - [BaseData_Bite.zip] = The bites coded with the program Cowlog for each video.
  - [BaseIMUdata_raw.zip] = The raw signal of the IMU corresponding to each video.

## 3. Model Tested

# Machine Learning Models

- **Description:** Two folders containing MATLAB `.mat` files of all machine learning models tested during the project.
- **Folders:**
